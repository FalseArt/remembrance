There are many types of players when it comes to RP and all playstyles are equally valid. However, not everyone will enjoy every server. Take the time to understand what to expect.

# Story Expectations:

- **Tone.** The typical standard heroic fantasy will be reconstructed. Your character will not start off as a hero, but may eventually become one in the future. The story takes place in a dark-fantasy setting where sci-fi elements lurk beneath the surface.
- **Roleplay.** As this is a roleplay server, it is expected that you are here to roleplay. This is not a server for those who just want to play Survival and build/mine.
- **Narrative Structure.** There are two storylines that your character will be apart of. The most important one is your personal journey that your character goes upon. This is where the majority of your RP will take place. The second storyline is a **flexilinear** story with NPCs that the player characters can help influence. The events in the ongoing storyline will add more discussion, events, and changes to help make your personal adventure more dynamic.
- **Characters.** Time and care should be put into your characters. Characters should feel fleshed out, but don’t stress—we’ll help you develop them!
  
## Accommodations

The setting is fairly grim and dark. Corruption awaits in every corner, and the world is not a pleasant one to be in. The setting also features more sensitive and mature themes that not everyone may be comfortable with. These themes will not be glorified. If you are not comfortable with the various themes then it is not recommended to join the server.

Uncomfortable aspects that may come up:

- Blood/Gore
- Harm to animals
- Harm to children
- Sex with a fade to black
- Emotional abuse
- Physical abuse
- Violent conflict
- Betrayal
- Gaslighting
- Genocide
- Implied sexual assault in the past
- Implied incest
- Suicide
- Body horror
- Racism

# Character Expectations:

- Your character can join for the exploration, the combat, or the treasure, but their importance should be conveyed through your character’s **beliefs, instincts, goals, strengths, and flaws.**
- Your character's capabilities are **not obtained in a vacuum.** Think carefully about how you gained skills and abilities. There's a story behind them - try to figure out what it is.
- Your character is **not an island.** Your fellow characters, as well as the NPCs, can be sources of courage, mystery, compassion, knowledge, or creativity. Engage them. Build relationships with them. Invest your character in their histories, their personalities, and their goals, and perhaps they'll do the same for you. *Or not.*
- **The story is not a series just the main story events**; it also includes everything that comes between. Make small talk, play a game, or create a contest. Be petty, thoughtful, spontaneous, or social. Treat downtime as an opportunity to create new scenes, rather than an opportunity to wait for the next story event.
- Every character should be shaped by **unfulfilled needs** or **past wounds**—whether it’s guilt over a mistake, grief for a loss, fear of failure, or longing for a place/person they can’t return to. This isn’t about being ‘edgy’—it’s about having **real stakes** that inform their desires and flaws. Stakes don’t need to be tragic—a baker who failed their family’s legacy can be as compelling as a soldier with unresolved trauma.
- Your character should not be made through the use of AI or anything similar. **They must be created by you.**
- **Your character should be separate from your identity.** No self-inserts or alternate versions of yourself.
- Your character cannot be pure evil. These characters can create conflict, be bullies and or be generally unpleasant people. However they should **not be cartoonishly evil villains with no morals at all.** 
- Your character does **not have magic or any sort of special abilities beyond the scope of an ordinary mortal.**
- Keep in mind that a well-crafted ordinary person in extraordinary circumstances is often more interesting than an extraordinary person in ordinary circumstances.
# Community Expectations

- **Conflict.** At some point, people will disagree and issues will arise. When conflict occurs, it is expected that people handle them in a mature and reasonable manner. That entails keeping a level head, and presenting your argument without insulting, attitude, etc. **Your emotions are perfectly valid**, but if they're in the way of vocalizing your thoughts in a healthy way, then take a step back until you are ready. Disagreements and voicing concerns is encouraged in the appropriate channel, please don't ever hesitate to do so there. More information will be found in the rules on this.
- **Acceptance.** Do not alienate new players or people in general. It's alright to have friends and frequently RP with a group of people you are comfortable with, but do not go out of your way to ignore new players and form a clique. You do not have to be friends with every single person, but be reasonable.
- **Treatment.** It is expected that you treat everyone with respect. Joking around with people you know is fine, but do not treat others with disrespect. Treat other people how you want to be treated.

***If you want rich storytelling, nuanced characters, and a true  impact on the world—this is your story.***
