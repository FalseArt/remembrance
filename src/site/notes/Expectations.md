There are many types of players when it comes to RP and all playstyles are equally valid. However, not everyone will enjoy every RP. Take the time to understand what to expect on the server when it comes to the setting, RP, rules, etc.

# Story Expectations:

- **Tone.** The typical standard heroic fantasy will be reconstructed. Your character will not start off as a hero, but may eventually become one in the future. The story takes place in a dark-fantasy setting with heavy sci-fi elements that will be introduced in the future.
- **Roleplay.** As this is a roleplay server, it is expected that you are here to roleplay. This is not a server for those who just want to play Survival.
- **Narrative Structure.** There are two storylines that your character will be apart of. The most important one is your personal journey that your character goes upon. This is where the majority of your RP will take place. The second storyline is a flexilinear story with NPCs that the player characters can help influence. The events in the ongoing storyline will add more discussion, events, and changes to help make your personal adventure more dynamic.
