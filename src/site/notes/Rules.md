These rules are expected to be known and understood by each player that joins.

# Minecraft Rules:

1. No griefing. Do not modify or destroy others' builds without explicit permission. This includes terraforming near other's land.
2. No stealing. Do not take items from chests, farms, or builds without anyone's consent.
3. No RDM. If you know the other person and you're joking around, it's fine unless it's during a serious RP scene.
4. Do not use glitches, hacked clients, or mods that give unfair advantages (e.g., X-ray, fly hacks). Report bugs to staff.
5. Builds must fit the medieval theme. No overly modern structures.
6. No iron/gold/raid farms. 
7. No dark room grinders. Mob grinders using spawners are allowed but must have an AFK kill switch.
8. Animals must have adequate space. No cramming in 1x1 holes or anything unreasonable in general.

## Roleplay Rules:

1. Use proper grammar, spelling and the English language when roleplaying.
2. No emoticons, breaking the fourth wall, or using modern slang during RP. You don't have to be a master at portraying a medieval character, but do not portray them as how you would online.
3. Romantic RP is fine if all parties consent to it including both the players and characters. **Sex is fine with a fade-to-black** but ERP is not allowed. **Do not act out sexual descriptions.** Romantic RP should be separate from your feelings as a player. Romance RP should also not be the main focus for your RP in general.
4. No power-gaming. Roleplay your actions but not the result, you must give others the opportunity to react. 
     - For example: Your character wishes to punch another character. The emote can't be, "*False punches True in the face.*" You must  give the other character a chance to react and respond. The appropriate way would be, "*False throws a punch towards True's face.*" The other person may then respond, "*True attempts to dodge the blow but it connects, sending her onto her back.*"
     - Do not try to have your character *win* in every situation. If your character is not proficient in fighting, then let them lose. If your character is poor with social situations, then have them fumble at that. Other players will appreciate others that can have their characters lose. Ultimately it will create a better character for you and a more fun RP experience.
5. No negative meta-gaming. **You can't use outside information that your character does not have to give them an advantage.**
    - An example of this is using someone's stream, or what someone said in Discord to have your character find them in-character. Your character did not gain that knowledge through RP and relied upon outside information.
    - **Positive meta-gaming is allowed.** It's used to solve problems that can make RP not fun. You can arrange RP scenes out of character and have people join up as long as it isn't that unreasonable for the characters and everyone is on board with it. You can speak with other players on what you're comfortable with in your scenes. Essentially, as long as everyone is comfortable with it and it makes sense for the characters, it can be fine.
