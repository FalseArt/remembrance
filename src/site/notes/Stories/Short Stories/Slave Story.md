In a small, dilapidated hut far to the north, there lived a small family of slaves. Captured a few years ago during a great war, they now tended to a meager patch of barley fields: a youngest brother, an oldest brother, and a mother. The youngest hated his family. His brother stayed in bed while his mother sat in a rocking chair all day. She said that the older brother was "just tired" and that she had "hurt her legs." But the youngest knew that to not be true—he had seen her walk just the other day. *Two-faced,* he thought. *How lazy. You're all worthless.*

The youngest worked four times as hard everyday. His hands were always raw from cutting barley with a rusty sickle, his legs were consistently covered with bloody scratches from the reeds, his back constantly ached from the bending he did, and his feet were regularly carpeted with blisters from trudging through the golden stalks.

One night, the youngest made their way to the master's house to report a trace of mold growing on the barley leaves. He entered through the main room, down the hall and saw dim light from his master's bedroom. Stepping inside was the master and his mother sleeping next to each other. *Shameless*, he thought. *How lazy, you're all worthless.*

As the youngest stepped outside, a fairy appeared and told the youngest with a voice sweet as honey, "Lucky you," she said. "I can free you, hee hee! Kill two related by blood, and you'll be free as one can be, tee hee!" 

The youngest frowned at the fairy, but nodded before heading off back home.

The youngest waited for his mother to return back to the hut. As the feeble woman began to sit down on her chair, the youngest lunged at her with a knife, knocking the mother to the ground. Her swollen body tumbled into his sight, as the youngest scoffed.  She screamed as he slashed at her hands, then plunging his knife into her stomach. *Greedy,* he thought. *How lazy, you're all worthless.*

Slowly shuffling over to where the oldest rested. He placed his hands around his neck, wringing them until he realized the oldest was cold and entirely still. *Dead,* he realized. *The deal was off.* The youngest takes his knife, and stabs his chest twisting it as he'd never be free.

The fairy finally arrived from her bathroom break, humming with glee. She looked at the four bodies—the oldest, the mother, the unborn child, and the youngest. *Impatient,* she giggled. *How lazy, you're all worthless.* With a shrug, she fluttered away into the night.
